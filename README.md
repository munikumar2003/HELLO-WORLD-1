Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. 
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
 It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990.
 Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
